Hi! My name is **Ville Lindholm** and I'm a freelance software engineer.

I've spent a lot of my professional life building web apps, mostly using full-stack **TypeScript** with **React** as the front-end library. However, I'm a passionate programming-language.-and-paradigm junkie, and will jump at the chance to work with (for example):

* Rust
* Elixir
* Any Lisp

Get in touch via e-mail, the address is `<my first name>@<my last name>.dev`.
