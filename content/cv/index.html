        <p>
            I am an experienced full stack software engineer currently based in Helsinki, Finland. I am interested in
            writing code that is readable, (appropriately) scalable and
            well-architected. I am always curious about new paradigms, patterns and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time I write poetry and fiction, read a lot of books and dabble in improvisational theatre
            and windsurfing. I also contribute to open source projects when I have the time!

                <strong>Years of experience: ~12 years</strong>. This is a rough estimate: I started learning
                programming as a teen in 1999 and my first programming job was in 2002,
                constructing web shops in Perl for my local ISP. I then worked on and off with coding until I graduated
                university, so it's hard to put a number on my "years of experience".

                    a more advanced permission system (backend + UI). Developed a "batch operations"
                    API for common tasks in the UI (think e-mail batch operations).

                    robust DevOps pipeline instead of manual deployments, bringing deployment time
                    down from hours/days to minutes (on both AWS and AWS China). Also worked on the
                    product itself, a Unity-based mobile app, mainly on asset organization improvements.
